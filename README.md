A collection of personal projects implemented in Google Collab
- NanoGPT: From Andrej Karpathy's class
- Reperti: Finetuning Stable Diffusion with ad hoc pictures
- Binary Logistic Regression Case Study: Marketing Campaign Response Model

## NanoGPT
The base components of GPT come from a paper called "Attention is all you need" which proposed the Transformer architecture. 
GPT stands for Generatively Pretrained Transformer, so the transformer is the neural network that does all the heavy work under the wood.
The transformer architecture has been copy-pasted with small modifications in a huge number of applications in AI.
Nano GPT is a transformer-based language model in particular a character-level language model trained on all Shakespeare.

## Reperti
Exploring fine-tuning techniques for text-to-image models. Teaching Stable Diffusion with a new concept using images.

## Binary Logistic Regression Case Study: Marketing Campaign Response Model
Background: A large skin clinic offers a variety of products and services to customers. A marketing campaign was launched to introduce a new product.
Data: The data shows the response to the marketing campaign along with demographic and transaction data of customers.
Objective: The objective is to identify factors driving response to the marketing campaign.

#Multiple Linear Regression Case Study: Boston Housing Prices 
Background: The data has 506 cases and each case is located in Boston. 
Data: The “median housing price” is a target variable. The data has many other variables related to environment, education, crime etc. which can influence the housing prices in the specific location
Objective: The objective is to identify significant factors affecting housing prices
